The problem that this data challenge tackles is the development of a model that is able to predict whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell. The breast cancer dataset was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. Details of the dataset can be found and downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original)).
